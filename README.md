This is a WoW addon that lets you talk to other factions with manageable level of comprehension loss.

## Using
```
/hermes Is it time for you to jump into the next train
```
Turns into:
```
	I S r I T r T l M E r F O R r Y O U r T O r G U M P r l N T O r T H E r N E X T r T R A I N
```

## Limitations
It's impossible to make certain letters appear, so this addon tries to substitute them to something close.

Orcish suffers in particular, because it misses a bunch of potentially interchangeable letters: B, P, V, W, F.

No punctuation or numbers are possible. Only some latin letters.

Only single space can be posted. But it is possible to use some downcase letters as delimeters.

## FAQ
> Isn't cross-faction communication prohibited by EULA?

No, Blizzard removed that rule in 2018.

> What can you write to another faction?

Most standard capital latin letters, some downcase latin letters and whitespaces.
